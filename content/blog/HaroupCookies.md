## The Haroup Wonder

These cookies are unique to the Laconian region in the Greek Peleponese, borne out of necessity,
Haroup flour became a staple food for the region.

##
Made by the local bakery in Molaoi, they are filled with tasty raisin and nutty morsels compliment the low sweetness these cookies
have.
It gets better, dip these suckers in coffee and they **don't fall apart** as they absorb all that tasty brown gold!

In our humble opinion, these are some the greatest cookies of all time.
